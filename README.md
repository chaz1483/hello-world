intro to programming

I intend to use GitHub to allow me to learn my field of study and collaborate with other like-minded folks having the intention to contribute to the community and ultimately using it as a platform to launch my career identity with a tried-and-true portfolio that paints a picture of where I have come from and underscores my potential all while allowing my contributions to have a real-world impact in the field.
